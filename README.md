# Scriblr (Legacy Code)
Scriblr is a decentralized hub for writers, readers, and publishers. Scriblr acts as an intersection between these three entities. 
## How it works
- **For writers:** Scriblr acts as a hub where new and experienced writers can write and upload their books, articles, poems, and scripts for readers and publishers for free or at a price, allowing readers to have easy access to the written medium all in one place and publisher having easy access to talent and hirers for long term employment or contracts
- **For Readers:** Scriblr acts as a one-size-fits-all library that isn't focused on big, popular names but rather quality content. Easily have access to books from your favourite author or build a collection of educational books and articles. Scriblr will have it all in your pockets
- **For Publishers:** Scriblr acts as a talent pool of various creatives, including various creative works. Publishers can hire writers on a full-time or contract basis. They could also choose to publish a certain work, a movie producer could find a script for his next movie and pay for the rights.

- The possibilities are endless.

## Note
This is an older, legacy version of Scriblr built in React. It was still in the works, but now I wanna rebuild it from the ground up with Next.js.
## The NEXT step
So I've learnt a lot in the past year that I was making Scriblr, I'm currently building fun side projects and other things, but when I get back to Scriblr, I want to do it right. I'm currently making the legacy code open source. Please adhere to the license, thank you
